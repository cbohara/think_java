public = methods that can be invoked from other classes
void = don't yield a result

main is followed by ( ) 
	contains a list of variables = parameters 
	where the method stores its arguments 
	main has a single parameter = args = type String[]
	whoever invokes main must provide an array of strings

execution always begins at the first line of main

when you use a method you provide the arguments
when you write a method you name the parameters 

round() rounds a floating point number to nearest int and returns a long
int 32 bits
log 64 bits

if you don't sepcify a class name the compiler looks at the current class
