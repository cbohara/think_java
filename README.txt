public = methods that can be invoked from other classes
void methods don't yield a result
value methods yield a result

main is followed by ( ) 
	contains a list of variables = parameters 
	where the method stores its arguments 
	main has a single parameter = args = type String[]
	whoever invokes main must provide an array of strings

execution always begins at the first line of main

when you use a method you provide the arguments
when you write a method you name the parameters 

if you don't specify a class name the compiler looks at the current class

overloading = having more than 1 method with the same name
it is legal as long as each version takes different parameters
Java will figure out which version to use based on argument provided
